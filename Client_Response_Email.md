Dear Good Monkeys LLC Team,

Thank you for these excellent feature suggestions! Your vision for the Flick app shows great forward-thinking. I'm pleased to address each of your requests and explain how we'll approach them within our MVP scope while setting the foundation for future expansion.

## 1. QR Code Scanning Enhancement ✅ **INCLUDED**

Your QR code behavior specification is **excellent** and we're excited to implement this comprehensive flow:

**✅ MVP Implementation:**
- Native iOS camera QR scanning with deep linking to the app
- Web-based QR landing pages for non-app users
- Smart routing based on lighter registration status
- "Lost/Found" decision interface for registered lighters
- "Download app" promotion for unregistered lighters
- In-app QR scanner remains available for registered users

This creates a seamless user experience that encourages app downloads while providing immediate value to anyone who finds a lighter.

## 2. Ownership History Feature ✅ **INCLUDED**

The ownership history concept adds tremendous value to the community aspect of Flick:

**✅ MVP Implementation:**
- Ownership chain tracking in our database schema
- Privacy-respecting display (only public profiles shown)
- Clean timeline view: "X → A → B → You"
- Optional privacy settings for each user
- Integration with existing trade/lost & found workflows

This feature will make each lighter's journey feel more personal and engaging for users.

## 3. Location Update Feature ✅ **INCLUDED**

Your proactive location tracking approach is innovative:

**✅ MVP Implementation:**
- Smart push notifications asking "Is your lighter with you?"
- One-tap responses (Yes/No)
- Automatic location updates when user confirms
- Follow-up "Is it lost?" flow for missing lighters
- Non-intrusive frequency (max 1-2 prompts per week)
- Respects user privacy and battery life

This will significantly improve the lost & found success rate while keeping the experience user-friendly.

## 4. Social Feed Architecture ✅ **FUTURE-READY**

**✅ MVP Foundation:**
We'll structure our backend and database to support social features from day one:

- **Database Design:** Activity log tables for trades, lost/found events, achievements
- **API Architecture:** Event-driven system ready for feed generation
- **User Interaction Tracking:** All actions logged for future social features
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Built to handle increased social activity

**Future Expansion Ready:**
When you're ready to add social feeds, we'll have all the data and infrastructure in place for a smooth implementation.

## 5. goodmonkeys.com Landing Website ✅ **ENHANCED SCOPE**

Your dual-purpose website concept is perfect for brand building:

**✅ MVP Implementation:**
- **Company Section:** About Good Monkeys LLC, mission, team
- **Flick App Section:** App introduction, features showcase, download buttons
- **Contact Form:** Professional contact system with email forwarding
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-optimized for all devices
