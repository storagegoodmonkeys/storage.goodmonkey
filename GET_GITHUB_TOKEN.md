# Get GitHub Personal Access Token

GitHub requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of passwords for git operations.

## Quick Steps:

1. **Go to GitHub Token Settings:**
   https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

2. **Fill in the form:**
   - **Note**: "Flick App Development"
   - **Expiration**: Choose (90 days recommended)
   - **Select scopes**: ✅ Check `repo` (Full control of private repositories)

3. **Click "Generate token"**

4. **Copy the token** (you'll only see it once! It starts with `ghp_...`)

5. **Share the token with me** and I'll push everything immediately!

**Alternative: I can help you push via GitHub Desktop or Xcode if you prefer!**
